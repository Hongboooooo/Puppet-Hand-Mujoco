# Puppet-Hand-Mujoco
construct robot hand used in Mujoco simulation for solving mocap data's hand penetration problem  
>  connect each joint of robot hand to the respective joint of original data with a tendon spring

>  when joints of original data penetrate an object, the connected robot hand will keep the correct collision with that object  

>  original data with hand penetration:
